<h2>Questions and Tests</h2>

<h4>Interest in IT</h4>
<p>My interest in IT has always been apparent. Growing up with a father who was an architect I was always surrounded by computers and technology at home. Luckily enough I also had a father who was interested in gaming so growing up I had access to an N64 and a desktop PC which has planted some fond memories in my gaming life. For example, beating The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time at an early age and playing Star Wars Pod Racing on the computer with a joystick.</p>
<p> This interest in gaming has carried on well into my adult life, in College I built my first computer, and I was hooked. That then spiraled into hours of research on how all the hardware and software worked in conjunction to bring us the computers we have today. I became the friend that was the go-to when building computers and to date have built around 30+ computers for family and friends.</p>
<p>  This year I decided to sign up with RMIT to hopefully achieve my bachelor's degree in information technology first starting with this course and with this, hope to secure a job as a software developer to hopefully design something that will change people's lives!</p>
<p> During my studies I hope to become fluent in multiple coding languages, become familiar with different creation environments and overall, just become more aware of the effect technology has on our lives whether it be positive or negative.</p>

<h4>Ideal Job</h4>
<p> My dream job in the IT field would be a software programmer of sorts.</p>
<a href=" https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PFz6zDSRK1FNDn2Upd07cptZGa7mU-c5/view?usp=sharing">Here is a link to a job i would want!</a>
<p> Savage is quite a familiar company for me as I have a friend who works there as a graphic designer. Savage developed one of IOS's most popular graphic design applications, Procreate. The company itself was founded in Tasmania so this is one aspect that is appealing to me. The job advertisement is seeking a bug fixing position for their software. To me, this would consist of sifting through code and application programs to see errors that have come from productions or updates.</p>
<p>Software development requires some form of experience in programming whether that be from a course or general knowledge and a degree in Information Technology. At the current time, I have bare minimal experience in these fields and technologies. But that is what I am seeking to change, by completing this course I will be set to start my bachelor's degree in information technology and in 3 years I hope to have sufficient skills to gain a job like the one advertised.</p>
